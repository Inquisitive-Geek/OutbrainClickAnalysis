# OutbrainClickAnalysis
A failed attempt to predict clicks of ads on Outbrain data

I tried to load the data in a Spark Cluster and build a preditive model using PySpark. The data load was successful, but the model building wasn't. I still learnt quite a bit here - working with a cloud cluster, loading packages, setting up an IPython notebook in it. Hence, I shared the IPython notebook here.
